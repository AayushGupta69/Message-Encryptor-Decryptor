# Description:
Encoding is the process of converting text into an incognizable language and
the reverse process in decoding. In this project, we will be using the Tkinter
module and base64 module to do the required operations.
In this,
1. The user first enters the message and key
2. And choose one of the encode or decode options
3. Based on the choice the corresponding operation is done
4. It is to be noted that the same key used for encryption needs to be
used during the decryption.
