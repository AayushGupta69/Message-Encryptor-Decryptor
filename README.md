Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language.
Python was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the
Python Software Foundation.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon
as it is written. This means that prototyping is very quick.
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems
more efficiently.
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).

Tkinter was written by Steen Lumholt and Guido Van Rossum, then later revised by
Fredrik Lundh.
Tkinter is the Python interface to Tk, which is the GUI toolkit for Tcl/Tk.
Tkinter is an open-source, cross-platform widget toolkit used by many programming
languages to build GUI programs.
Tkinter provides us with a variety of common GUI elements which we can further
use to build our interface such as buttons, menus and various kinds of entry fields
and display areas.
Tkinter works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc).

Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data.
Base64 is designed to carry data stored in binary format across the channels that
only reliably support text content.
Base64 is used obfuscate data or to mask it so that it’s not human readable.

Message Encryptor-Decryptor is a program which enables the user to encrypt and decrypt the messages
easily, allows them a secure way to have their messages secure or to decrypt the message
easily, etc.
The various app screens and features used in the website are as follows:
•
•
•
Encrypt Window: It is the entry point from where one can encrypt their message.
Decrypt Window: This window contains the message which will have to be decoded.
Function Button: It can encrypt the message using the key and can decrypt the
encrypted hash using same key.

# Description:
Encoding is the process of converting text into an incognizable language and
the reverse process in decoding. In this project, we will be using the Tkinter
module and base64 module to do the required operations.
In this,
1. The user first enters the message and key
2. And choose one of the encode or decode options
3. Based on the choice the corresponding operation is done
4. It is to be noted that the same key used for encryption needs to be
used during the decryption.
